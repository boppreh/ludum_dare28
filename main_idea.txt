your weapon is a bouncing ball
when the ball touches an enemy, it takes damage and/or dies and the ball bounces
if you touch the ball you pick it up again automatically

what if you don't pick it up? what happens?



player controls entity inside fenced area
ball with zero friction, goes on forever
if bounce misses, player has to wait for it to come back
defend the area


entity follows mouse
left button controls grabbing
enemies come from border
enemies deal damage to entity


POWERUPS!



alternative
you can always touch the ball, but only control it by expelling force
playing bowling using a industry sized fan
