You Only Get One
================

Abstract Ideas
--------------

- one of something usable/disposable
-- battery (robot with short life)
-- ink cartridge, eraser, pencil
-- ammo clip

Modifies the "one" into different units seamlessly. X time, Y bullets, Z
meters of drawing/erasing. Much more potential.


- everyone else gets many
-- some sport?
-- forces you to plan while everyone else goes crazy
-- option for "symmetric" game with asymmetric AI

Hard to think of such a sport. Maybe something abstract, invent a new sport?


- one action (waiting and precision, or chain reaction)
-- one arrow to hit all targets
-- one bomb to start the chain reaction
-- wait for everything to line up

Boring. Requires too many explanations and the user must be utmost careful. If
coupled with level system could be doable. Too much fine tuning to create
levels.



Concrete Ideas
--------------

- Robot has only X seconds to live (battery worry is too far away until it
  becomes overwhelming suddenly, not good)

- Limited ink to draw (draw what?) REQUIRES PIXEL COLLISION

- Limited eraser to clear (clear what?) REQUIRES PIXEL COLLISION

- Asymmetric game

- Chain reaction game

- One ammunition: a bouncing ball. Must bounce ball on enemies to kill/damage.
  If you calculate wrong, you have to go fetch it, defenseless.
